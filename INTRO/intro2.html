                    Color Mixing
                </h3>

                <p class="t">
                    Mixing two or more colors together and having a different shade of a color as a result is called color mixing. This is a type 
                    of color experiment that artists always do when the color that they are going to use isn't available. The color wheel is a 
                    visual example of color mixing, and it demonstrates important color relationships (MacNaughton, 2023).
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    There are 2 mixing models used in different scenarios.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    RGB: Additive Color Mixing Model
                </h3>

                <p class="t">
                    This is what colors humans see in wavelengths. This uses red, green and blue as the primary colors for mixing. By adding 
                    different wavelengths from the visible light spectrum with different levels of intensity, you can create different colors. 
                    Adding all different wavelengths, the eyes will see it as white. This model can be used for TVs, phones, tablets or any 
                    electronic gadgets since they produce light to display and visualize images. This is why what you print can be different 
                    from what you can see on the screen, as the printers use the CMYK color mixing model.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    CMYK: Subtractive Color Mixing Model
                </h3>

                <p class="t">
                    This model uses colors without the use of wavelength or by subtracting the light by simply adding color. People are more 
                    familiar with this method of color mixing since this is what we learn in art class. CMYK stands for cyan, magenta, yellow 
                    and key/black, which you can typically see what printers use. It is known previously as  your red, yellow and blue colors. 
                    However, the creation of printers replaced it with the cyan, magenta, yellow and black. That is why if you ever use the 
                    printer, the outcome of the colors is different from when it was on screen. Compared to the RGB model, mixing all colors 
                    of the CMYK model results in black.

                <h3>
                    Hues
                </h3>

                <p class="t">
                    Hue is the most basic aspect of color and refers  to the specific color itself such as red, blue, yellow, green, and so on.  
                    It's the first thing you see when you look at a color, and it's usually determined by its position on the color wheel. The 
                    basic colors are primary hues red, blue, and yellow which cannot be created by mixing other colors. These primary colors 
                    serve as the building blocks for all other colors. Secondary colors are created when you mix two primary hues together. 
                    Tertiary colors are created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color.
                </p>
                <p class="t">
                    Keeping what we learned in color mixing we can create the different hues of the color wheel. Using only the primary colors: <br>
                    <span class="r"></span>Red + <span class="y"></span>Yellow = <span class="o"></span>Orange. <br>
                    <span class="y"></span>Yellow + <span class="b"></span>Blue = <span class="g"></span>Green. <br>
                    <span class="b"></span>Blue + <span class="r"></span>Red = <span class="p"></span>Purple. <br>
                    The mixtures among the primary colors results in secondary colors.
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Using the primary colors with secondary colors: <br>
                    <span class="r"></span>Red + <span class="o"></span>Orange = <span class="ro"></span>Red orange. <br>
                    <span class="o"></span>Orange + <span class="y"></span>Yellow = <span class="yo"></span>Yellow orange. <br>
                    <span class="y"></span>Yellow + <span class="g"></span>Green = <span class="yg"></span>Yellow green. <br>
                    <span class="g"></span>Green + <span class="b"></span>Blue = <span class="bg"></span>Cyan. <br>
                    <span class="b"></span>Blue + <span class="p"></span>Purple = <span class="bv"></span>Indigo. <br>
                    These colors are known as tertiary colors, a mixture of primary and secondary colors.
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    The primary, secondary and tertiary colors are what you will see in a typical color wheel. However, it is not only limited 
                    to that, there are colors in between the categories.
