                    Value

                <p class="t">
                    Value in art is primarily determined by the lightness or darkness of something, ranging from white to black 
                    (where white represents the highest value and black the lowest value). Many believe that it is crucial to a 
                    painting's success, even more than the choice of color. Understanding the value of art should be straightforward. 
                    Nevertheless, incorporating color can present difficulties in understanding the concept. Two distinct colors may 
                    seem completely unrelated, yet they share the same value. There would be minimal difference in these colors even 
                    though they have varying shades. (drawpaintacademy)

                <p class="t">
                    Choose 2 colors. On the bigger boxes you would see the comparison of the two colors in their most desaturated form. Such as
                    yellow and blue, even in without the grayscale filter yellow would appear brighter than blue and red as this is how our eyes 
                    perceive it. In the visible light spectrum, the wavelength of yellow is on the longer side, meaning we could also 
                    see it from afar, that is why all stop lights and signals are red for us to see better especially if you are 
                    driving 40km/h or higher. Another factor is our photoreceptors, our eyes are more sensitive to green and yellow colors. Many
                    more could also affect on why we see yellow brighter, such as culture, its luminance and its comparison with other colors.

                    If you know your value, you could color an artwork more efficiently. Some artists starts their coloring using only grayscale or
                    black, white and gray then after adding those, they would color with colors of their choice, with that they could save time of
                    finding the right shade for the shadows and highlights. Still it is important to know how colors work together. A good exercise
                    is playing with the black, gray and white first before you learn and use colors, know where to put shadows and highlights, know where
                    light is coming from in your artwork with only shading. Take the artwork below as an example, colors were generated in a 
                    grayscale filter and the artist used it to color their work.

                <h3>
                    Saturation
                </h3>

                <p class="t">
                    Saturation refers to the level of purity or intensity of a color. The colors we typically purchase at their 
                    strongest saturation levels in art stores, like cadmium red or ultramarine blue, cannot be made any more intense. 
                    The tube of paint is completely saturated at the time of purchase. The saturation of cadmium red decreases only 
                    when we mix in other colors, particularly black and white. When colors are desaturated with black and white, they 
                    become less vibrant. Nevertheless, saturation is constantly subjective. If we mix a small amount of orange with black 
                    and white to create grey, it will appear more saturated compared to a grey made solely from black and white. Black and 
                    White lack saturation, therefore mixing them with other colors reduces the saturation of the colors.    
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Saturated and desaturated colors could be used in many ways. This can be use to create distance, mood or atmosphere, emphasis
                    on the subject and context.

                <p class="t">
                    Tones are mixtures of hue or any color and grey. It is considered as the neutral colors. It is use to grays are used to desaturate a color,
                    it will not darken or lighten the color but will tone down the intensity of it.

                    Tints are mixtures of hue or any color and white. It is sometimes called pastel. Though they appear bright they are only lighten using
                    white. It is the same color only paler than before. This is one of the things that makes up the value of a color.
