                    Mixing two or more colors together and having a different shade of a color as a result is called color mixing. 
                    This is a type of color experiment that artists always do when the color that they are going to use isn't available. 
                    The color wheel is a visual example of color mixing, and it demonstrates important color relationships (MacNaughton, 2023).

                    Hue is the most basic aspect of color and refers  to the specific color itself such as red, blue, yellow, green, and so on.  
                    It's the first thing you see when you look at a color, and it's usually determined by its position on the color wheel.
                    now we will go to the understanding of hue. First is basic colors There are primary hues red, blue, and yellow which 
                    cannot be created by mixing other colors. These primary colors serve as the building blocks for all other colors. 
                    Second are Secondary Colors When you mix two primary hues together, you get secondary hues. and the last is Tertiary 
                    Colors By mixing a primary color with a secondary color, you create tertiary colors.

                    Keeping what we learned in color mixing we can create the different hues of the color wheel. Using only the primary colors,
                    <span class="r"></span>red mix with <span class="y"></span>yellow, results to <span class="o"></span>orange. 
                    <span class="y"></span>Yellow mix with <span class="b"></span>blue, results to <span class="g"></span>green. 
                    <span class="b"></span>Blue mix with <span class="r"></span>red, results in <span class="p"></span>purple. 
                    The mixtures among the primary colors results in secondary colors.
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Using the primary colors with secondary colors, <span class="r"></span>red mix with <span class="o"></span>orange 
                    results in <span class="ro"></span>red orange. <span class="o"></span>Orange mix with <span class="y"></span>yellow, 
                    results in <span class="yo"></span>yellow orange. <span class="y"></span>Yellow mix with <span class="g"></span>green
                    results in <span class="yg"></span>yellow green. <span class="g"></span>Green mix with <span class="b"></span>blue, 
                    results in <span class="bg"></span>cyan. <span class="b"></span>Blue mix with <span class="p"></span>purple, 
                    results in <span class="bv"></span>indigo. These colors are known as tertiary colors, a mixture of primary and secondary colors.
