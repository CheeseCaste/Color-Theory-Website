                    As an artist it is essential for me to know color theory. During my years of making art I always have a difficult time applying colors
                    in my work, so I have only draw in black and white. However, learning color theory is very important as colors will further enhance your
                    artwork. Color theory is a study of how colors works together and the message it convey to us. It is used by all artists, designers and
                    creaters to convey emotions and messages of their work. The traditional color theory uses the color wheel which comprises the
                    primary, secondary and tertiary colors. This theory was developed by Isaac Newton in 1666 when he invented the color wheel, which is
                    still used today. Newton saw that colors are human perception not only just qualities of light. Still colors are created using light, which 
                    are created by certain wavelengths and frequency, that is where visible light comes in. Below is the visible light spectrum.
