                    Value in art is primarily determined by the lightness or darkness of something, ranging from white to black 
                    (where white represents the highest value and black the lowest value). Many believe that it is crucial to a 
                    painting's success, even more than the choice of color. Understanding the value of art should be straightforward. 
                    Nevertheless, incorporating color can present difficulties in understanding the concept. Two distinct colors may 
                    seem completely unrelated, yet they share the same value. There would be minimal difference in these colors even 
                    though they have varying shades. (drawpaintacademy)

                    Saturation refers to the level of purity or intensity of a color. The colors we typically purchase at their 
                    strongest saturation levels in art stores, like cadmium red or ultramarine blue, cannot be made any more intense. 
                    The tube of paint is completely saturated at the time of purchase. The saturation of cadmium red decreases only 
                    when we mix in other colors, particularly black and white. When colors are desaturated with black and white, they 
                    become less vibrant. Nevertheless, saturation is constantly subjective. If we mix a small amount of orange with black 
                    and white to create grey, it will appear more saturated compared to a grey made solely from black and white. Black and 
                    White lack saturation, therefore mixing them with other colors reduces the saturation of the colors.
