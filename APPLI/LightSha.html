        In visual art and design, lighting and shadow play a crucial role in conveying meaning, mood, and depth. The three images presented 
        illustrate how these elements affect perception. The first two images depict a woman looking out a window, with differences in lighting 
        that convey contrasting atmospheres. The third image shows a chess piece casting a shadow, demonstrating the power of contrast and the 
        symbolic use of light and shadow in minimalistic design.

        When comparing all three images, you can see how the lighting creates different moods. In the first image with the chess piece, the 
        lighting is very dramatic. The bright light on the king piece, paired with the long shadow, makes the scene feel intense and a little 
        lonely. The shadow stretching across the chessboard gives a sense of mystery or anticipation, like something important is about to 
        happen. In contrast, the second and third images of the figure by the window use lighting to create softer, more emotional moments. 
        The second image, with its cooler, blue tones, feels calm and quiet, as if the person is lost in thought during the early morning or 
        a rainy afternoon. But in the third image, the warmer orange lighting completely changes the mood, making the scene feel more emotional, 
        like a sunset moment full of nostalgia or warmth.

        Lighting in all three images also helps guide your attention, but in different ways. In the chess piece image, the bright light on the 
        king immediately draws your eye to it, making it the center of focus. The shadow adds depth, making you wonder what else is happening 
        on the board. On the other hand, the two window images direct your attention to the figure, who’s holding an ball and gazing out the 
        window. While both images focus on the same figure, the difference in lighting changes how we see them. The cool lighting in the second 
        image makes the figure seem more thoughtful or sad, while the warm lighting in the third image gives off a more peaceful or even hopeful 
        vibe. This shows how lighting can not only guide where we look but also change how we feel about what we’re looking at.

        lighting and shadowing play a big role in how we experience these images. They set the mood, direct our focus, and add depth, making 
        the scenes feel more real and emotionally impactful. Whether it’s the intense, lonely mood of the chess piece or the quiet, reflective 
        mood of the figure by the window, the way light and shadow are used can completely change how we feel about an image. These techniques 
        help artists tell a story through their artwork, showing how even simple changes in light can make a huge difference.
