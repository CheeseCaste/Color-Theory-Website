            <h1 class="hh1">#1: THE FOUNDATION OF USING COLOR THEORY</h1>

            <p class="t">
                <span class="bold">Hue is asking you to know the focus of your artwork</span>.  In creating tension and eye movement using color theory, beforehand, ask 
                yourself <em class="ital">WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GUIDE THE EYE OF YOUR VIEWER? </em>
            </p>

            <p class="t">
                Leading your viewers attention on what your artwork emphasizes is critical therefore try to overlook such artwork and practice 
                your eye movement and identify what it emphasizes. For instances;
            </p>

            <img class="img1" src="/img2/2nd.png">

            <p class="t">
                As you can see, the artwork applies color theory, specifically color scheme, value, saturation, shadow, and lighting. Your 
                artwork should have a subject in which your subject color stands out the most. For example, in the image above, the artist used 
                warm colors for the subject and cool hues for the background. With this, the artist made it easier for the viewer to understand 
                what the artwork was about.
            </p>

            <p class="t">
                In controlling your viewers attention, you should use colors that can build a pathway to subject color or the point of interest 
                of an artwork as shown below;
            </p>

            <img class="img1" src="/img2/1st.png">

            <p class="t">
                It is essential to determine your objective in creating a piece of art and to consider which colors hold significance for your 
                subject. This approach allows your audience to grasp the essence of your artwork through the colors you choose to employ.
            </p>

            <h1 class="hh1">#2A: Use of warm colors & cool colors</h1>

            <img class="img2" src="/img2/images.jpeg">

            <p class="t">
                In the color wheel, warm colors and cool colors are color temperatures that are visible to identify based on how it evokes. It 
                is highly suggested that when creating an artwork such as portrait painting, use warm colors to bring out as cool colors push 
                back. Otherwise, you can make use of warm colors for the main subject of your painting while cool colors for the background just 
                like the picture shown below;
            </p>

            <img class="img2" src="/img2/flowergirl.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                The color red clearly grabs the viewer's attention as it stands out, while the color blue in the backdrop recedes. Both color 
                temperatures are harmonious, with warm colors having more visual weight and creating more sensation.
            </p>

            <h1 class="hh1">#2B: Use of warm colors & cool colors</h1>

            <p class="t">
                To establish harmony in your artwork, consider using opposite warm and cold colors for lighting and shadows. Simply when your 
                light source is warm, your shadow must be cool; oppositely, when your light source is cool, your shadow must be warm. Look at 
                the photography below;
            </p>

            <img class="img1" src="/img2/bird.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                Direct lighting from this photography, If the light is warmer, the shadow contains less warm light. If the light that strikes an 
                object is cooler, there is less cool light in its shadow. This is what the photo shows; in the first half of the picture, the 
                lighting is cool (green), therefore the shadows are warm (red), similar to the second picture and opposite of the last picture. 
                Use this advice to make the colors in your artwork work together, especially when attempting to symbolize your subject through 
                colors, as shown in the last few sections of this website, specifically "psychology of colors".

            <h1 class="hh1">#3: COLOR HARMONIES INTO COLOR PALETTE</h1>

            <img class="img1" src="/img2/colorcombi.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                When you're having trouble deciding on another hue to go with the one you've chosen, try to remember the lessons you learned 
                before coming here. This implies the color scheme or color harmony. Color harmony is the foundation of all design and artwork, 
                since designers employ color relationships to express messages and create a specific style or feel. For instance, in the logo 
                shown below;
            </p>

            <img class="img3" src="/img2/LOGO.png">

            <p class="t">
                The artist chose yellow with increased saturation and decided to employ complementary colors (two colors facing each other) to 
                determine which hue best matched it. As a result, the artist combined it with the hue blue. The palette is as follows:
            </p>

            <img class="img2" src="/img2/AD LOGO_20241024_135317_0000.png">

            <p class="t">
                The palette contains complementary colors and in each hue, there are different tints and shades employed to make the logo pop.
            </p>

        <div class="column right">

            <p class="t">
                Therefore, to create harmonies, try to prepare a set of palette from different color schemes and decide which is better for 
                your artwork. It can be Analogous, Complementary, Monochromatic etc. Make it as simple as harmonize. Below are the other examples 
                retrieved from https://pin.it/AUPiTnaLX
            </p>

            <img class="img2" src="/img2/6works.jpg">

            <h1 class="hh1">#3A: Less color is more or Consider the colors you should use.</h1>

            <img class="img1" src="/img2/tvscreen.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                Above is a bunch of colors that are difficult to work with. Color your artwork with balance. Too much color with the same 
                vibrancy, tone, and saturation is unpleasant and untidy. Choose an important color and pair it with another hue that promotes 
                harmony. Less color is preferable because it allows you to highlight the subject of your artwork. Use a palette that is 
                compatible with each other and appropriate for the context of your artwork.
            </p>

            <h1 class="hh1">#4: Neutral Colors</h1>

            <img class="img2" src="/img2/neutralcolorpalette.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                Neutral colors include black, white, gray, brown, beige, and taupe. Earth tones, or natural colors, are also called neutral. 
                Neutral colors are not visible on the color wheel. Using neutral hues highlights your primary and secondary colors, which helps 
                to complement them. Neutral colors can be used as a base and to fill negative spaces, as demonstrated in the image below.
            </p>
             
            <img class="img1" src="/img2/Beige-neutral-room-decor.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                In the image above, the designer chooses cream or beige neutral hues to keep the interior look tidy. The other colors are well-
                matched, making it an excellent design for a family room. Neutral colors are essential simply consider what to wear on such 
                occasions when determining which colors complement your skin tone.
            </p>

            <h1 class="hh1">#5: Contrast</h1>

            <p class="t">
                Contrast is described as the juxtaposition of two distinct parts that work together to form a balanced total. In coloring your 
                artwork, beforehand, try to turn everything into grayscale just like the picture below retrieved from 
                https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LeZc-uYXv3Y/maxresdefault.jpg; 
            </p>

            <img class="img1" src="/img2/maxresdefault.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                The grayscale image above shows the various values used. Without the contrast of the value, the image or topic will be plain 
                sight, as seen in the photo below. 
            </p>

            <img class="img2" src="/img2/dog.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                As a result, value is vital in making artwork to highlight the difference within the subject matter and point out what is 
                significant. No contrast means the color doesn’t matter. 
            </p>

            <h1 class="hh1">#6:  Use 60-30-10 rule</h1>

            <img class="img1" src="/img2/60 30 10.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                The 60-30-10 rule is a basic design theory that divides a room's colors into three categories: dominant, secondary, and accent. 
                The dominating color should make up 60% of the room's color scheme, followed by the secondary color at 30% and the accent color 
                at 10%. Starting your artwork using this guide can create balance and harmony. Just like the picture shown below; 
            </p>

            <img class="img2" src="/img2/house orange.jpg">

            <p class="t">
                Understanding the entire color theory is simple; nevertheless, implementing it is tough. These tips and tricks are the most 
                commonly employed by experts, but that doesn't mean you can't set your own guidelines as an artist. Simply recall your aim in 
                your artwork and experience every necessity in your artwork as you begin and continue the progress you've achieved, where you 
                may add any value, saturation, tones, and tints to make your artwork fancy and stunning. The main purpose of coloring with color 
                theory is to achieve harmony and balance throughout your artwork.
