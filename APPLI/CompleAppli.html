                <h3>How to color with complementary colors</h3>

                <p class="t">
                    Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide using Purple as the base color and Yellow as the complementary color:
                </p>

                <img src="/img2/Comple.jpg" class="imga">

                <p class="s">
                    Step 1: Base Color - Purple
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Start with Purple as the primary color. Use this for the sky, mountains, and background. It should dominate most of the 
                    scene. <br>
                    Purple in the sky: This sets a calm and mystical atmosphere. Make the sky a gradient of light to darker shades of purple to 
                    create depth. <br>
                    Mountains and ground: Use varying shades of purple to give a layered effect, showing different mountain ranges. The deeper the 
                    shade, the farther the mountains appear. <br>
                </p>

                <p class="s">
                    Step 2: Complementary Color Yellow for the Sun
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Add the sun using Yellow. Place it in the sky so that it contrasts strongly against the purple background. <br>
                    Make the sun the focal point: The bright yellow draws attention and adds warmth to the scene. This contrast of yellow against 
                    purple highlights the importance of the sun in the composition.
                </p>

                <p class="s">
                    Step 3: Balance of Colors
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Maintain harmony by keeping the focus on the purple elements. Only use yellow in small areas, like the sun or highlights, to 
                    avoid overwhelming the design. <br>
                    The yellow sun stands out but does not overpower the overall calmness created by the purple, preserving balance.
                </p>

                <p class="s">
                    Step 4: Foreground Details
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Tree and shadows: Add a tree or other elements in darker shades of purple to ground the composition. This helps connect the 
                    different elements of the picture without introducing too many distracting colors.
                </p>

                <p class="s">
                    Step 5: Contrast and Focus
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Teach contrast: The strong contrast between purple and yellow demonstrates how complementary colors create emphasis. This can 
                    help in understanding how to direct focus to key elements (like the sun) while maintaining an overall sense of harmony.
                </p>

                <p class="s">
                    Step 6: Tasks for students
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Students can experiment with their own versions by applying complementary colors (like purple and yellow) to highlight focal 
                    points in artwork. They can try enhancing different elements without overwhelming the design, learning how to effectively use 
                    contrast and balance.
                </p>

                <p class="f">
                    The use of purple and yellow in this scene illustrates the power of complementary colors. Purple creates a calm, cool 
                    environment, while yellow adds warmth and contrast, ensuring the design remains visually engaging and balanced.
                </p>

                <p class="f">
                    This method can help teach students about effective color use in design, ensuring they understand how to create a visually 
                    appealing and balanced composition.
