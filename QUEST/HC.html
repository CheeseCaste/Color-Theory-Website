                <h3>History of Colors</h3>

                <p class="t">
                    Isaac Newton discovered in the 1660s that sunlight, which appears white to humans, is actually composed of seven colors: 
                    violet, blue, indigo, green, yellow, and red (ROYGBIV). There is a fascinating history behind the creation of each of these 
                    colors. Red, for instance, was produced in various ways over time. Cochineal beetles were crushed by people in 16th-century 
                    Mexico to create a highly valuable vivid crimson dye. Red ochre, a naturally occurring pigment found in the earth, was 
                    utilized by prehistoric Europeans and ancient Egyptians to generate red for their cave paintings and other artwork as early 
                    as 75,000 BCE.
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    Around 1500 BCE, the mineral realgar—from which orange is made—was utilized in ancient China and Rome. Later, during Europe's 
                    Renaissance (14th–17th century), individuals began combining yellow and red paints to create orange. In contrast, yellow was
                    derived from earthly minerals that were used in ancient Egypt approximately 2000 BCE or from plants like saffron, which was 
                    used in ancient Greece around 1700 BCE. 
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    People used minerals like malachite, which was widely available in ancient Egypt circa 4000 BCE, or a combination of yellow 
                    and blue for green. Because it was derived from the costly stone lapis lazuli, which was mined in Afghanistan as early as 
                    6000 BCE, blue was extremely rare and valuable. This stone was used to create ultramarine, a vivid blue color that was highly 
                    valued and costly during the European Renaissance. As early as 2000 BCE, indigo plants, which are primarily found in India, 
                    were used to make the deep blue dye. In the 16th century, it gained a lot of popularity in Europe. Purple or violet dye was 
                    very costly and scarce. Around 1500 BCE, it originated from sea snails in Phoenicia (present-day Lebanon), and because it was 
                    so expensive, only the aristocracy in ancient Rome could afford to dress in purple. Later, however, scientists began producing 
                    synthetic dyes in laboratories, which reduced the cost and simplified the buying of colors.
