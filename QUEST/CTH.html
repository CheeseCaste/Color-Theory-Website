                <p class="t">
                    2000 years before Newton's color theory, Greeks and Aristotle in particular stated that all colors came from white and black 
                    or lightness and darkness and related them to the four elements (water, air, earth and fire). In 1660s, English physicist and 
                    mathematician, Isaac Newton, through his experiments and discoveries using the light to pass through the prism, developed the 
                    first color wheel and ROYGBIV colors or the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet which is used in the visible 
                    light spectrum. He suggested that the primary colors are red, green and blue which he correlates to the cones in our eyes to 
                    distinguish colors. However, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a German poet, artist and politician, argued with Newton color 
                    theory and was the first to study the physiological effects of color. He suggested that Newton's may be scientifically 
                    correct, but colors are subjective. He believed that darkness is an active ingredient rather than the absence of light. 
                    He distinguished how colors work in nature. He explored the psychological effects of colors that were used by artists from 
                    then till now to convey a mood or emotion in their artwork.
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    During the 18th century, Jacob Christoph Le Blon invented a color printing method using the colors red, yellow and blue to 
                    create secondary colors which are used to imitate paintings. He was the first to analyze the importance of coloring 
                    materials which are used by painters or artists and colored light that Newton's Color Theory focuses on. Through that he 
                    established the 2 color models which are the additive RGB model or additive color model and CMYK or subtractive color model. 
                    Those models are then used in today's technologies such as in TVs, computer screen and mobile devices which uses the RGB 
                    model and pamphlets, brochure and other printable work uses the CMYK model. 
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    In addition, the understanding of colors in nature and 'color blindness' was studied by Abbott Thayer, an American artist. 
                    He introduced the concept of Disruptive Patterning, which suggests how animals are able to camouflage in their surroundings 
                    and how some people's eyes have a harder time distinguishing colors.  That theory was then still used in the military.
                </p>

                <p class="t">
                    These theories would go on to be applied today in the making of synthetic dyes and the likes which are used by artists and 
                    the industry that helped established the concept of colors and its name.
